# Trivia Game Kata

## Description

The goal for today's kata is to retrofit tests to existing legacy code, and to refactor the code and make it better. Use the techniques we’ve seen in previous katas.

* Grab the C# code from https://github.com/jbrains/trivia and add tests to the existing code. Refactor the code to make it better.
* Rules:
 * You are not allowed to break the code (i.e. changing method signatures).


## TODO

We didn't have time to refactor.
